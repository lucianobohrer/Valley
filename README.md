```Swift
// JSON
ValleyFile<[[String: Any]]>.request(url: "https://yourwebsite.com/data.json") { (json) in }

```Swift
let task = imageView.valleyImage(url: "https://yourwebseite.com/img.jpeg")
task.cancel()
```

```Swift
imageView.valleyImage(url: "https://yourwebseite.com/img.jpeg", placeholder: image)
```

The following method clear all items from cache

```Swift
Valley.cache.clearCache()
